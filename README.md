The *Oporto Model United Nations* or *OPOMUN* is the official Model United Nations of the city of Porto, Portugal. Hosted every year by *CLIP - The Oporto International School*, *OPOMUN* is a internationally renown event, bringing in schools from all over the globe, and joining students from 14 to 18 in several rooms, for intense UN-inspired debates.

## This Repository

In an effort to create a more technologically connected *Model United Nations*, *OPOMUN* is creating its own web platform, not only to serve as a static source of *MUN* related information, but also as a way for delegates to submit their clauses trough a more connected and modern web interface, henceforth simplifying the process of clause submission and presentation.

This repository contains the web-based code that hosts the content management platform for *OPOMUN*. This proprietary, purpose built code is built in `ASP.NET`, using `VB.NET` as it's code source.

## Features

The following features are being planned and maintained by the OPOMUN team:

- [x] Static informative content
- [x] Universal page design/CSS framework
- [ ] Engine for Content Submission
- [ ] Authentication and organization system
- [x] Mobile device compatibility/responsiveness
